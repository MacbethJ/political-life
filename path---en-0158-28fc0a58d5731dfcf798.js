Let each doctoral student talk about recent books, thoughts, and articles. There are a few who talk about some ideas that are worth studying:</p>\n<p>The impact of population growth on government organizations. This is a very good topic, and it cuts the current state of development of Chinese society. I asked: Is there any research on the impact of population growth on government organizations? In fact, such problems are already in front of us, and Shanghai has experienced a negative population growth. Although it is the only one in the country, the big cities will develop in this direction in the future, so it is necessary to come to the rain.</p>\n<p>Local election system and economic behavior of local governments. This is also a good subject, and the electoral system is increasingly affecting the economic behavior of local governments. With the improvement of our political system, some new mechanisms are taking shape and have a great impact on political behavior. Many of them were not in the past, and we did not expect it when we developed the political system. We must strengthen research.</p>\n<p>The development of social morality under the conditions of market economy. This topic is very worthy of study. Under the tide of the market economy, the position of morality is uncertain, people do not have a clear identity, and the inner core value of morality needs to be updated. This task is always in the early stages of economic development, but it may be too late to wait until it is ranked.</p>\n<p>New collectivism. The one who focuses on the spiritual life of the enterprise gives a definition that "new collectivism", that is, "independent enterprises and independent individuals who pursue the maximization of profits and the formation of a community of destiny", may be too economical. How to establish the values ​​of collectivism under the current new development situation is probably the rationale of the super-large society.</p>\n<p>Comparison of business and government relations models. This is the problem that we need to study the most. The reality is the strongest. Economic development is increasingly asking us to solve this problem. First, the government function can be exercised vigorously and properly. Second, the economy can develop fully and healthily. . Encouraging the impact of thoughts in the classroom and getting the spark of thought is one of the principles of education.</p>\n<p>In the evening, I moved a "guy" to the fifth floor, and I was so tired that I was very tired.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0158.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0158.md",frontmatter:{title:"Friday, October 14th"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0158.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
