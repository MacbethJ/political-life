This is a research topic established for the development of Shanghai in the 21st century, and it is also a strategy of choice. The development of a country and a city must have a clear strategy, and the choice of strategy is to choose a wise development path.</p>\n<p>In his speech, Professor T of Beijing emphasized the "new strategy centered on human development". This is a highly and culturally opinion. The basic opinions are:</p>\n<p>"The economy is the center." This concept shows that the economy is not isolated and closed. It is open and constantly reformed. It not only penetrates into all areas of human society and nature, but also penetrates into the economy in all fields."</p>\n<p>"A socio-economic strategy centered on human development is briefly summarized as: human brain plus computer. The human brain is always the first."</p>\n<p>This is a philosophical opinion and an opinion that is consistent with the development trend of human society.</p>\n<p>In the past few years, an international conference was held in Amman. The meeting presented a report to the United Nations stating that in the past four decades, many countries have paid little attention to human needs, human concerns and human development. The report recommends that the international development strategy of the 1990s should focus on human development and regard people\'s life as the first development strategy, making people the main driving force and main beneficiary of future economic development.</p>\n<p>In the early days of development, developing countries generally did not pay too much attention to human development, or because they did not pay attention or had no resources to pay attention to. After the economic development reaches a certain stage, this development strategy must be established. Otherwise, the economy will eventually be difficult to develop, or it will develop, and people will be lost. It is especially important to clarify such a consciousness in a society with a relatively low level of economic development, a relatively tight social resource, and a relatively large population.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0182.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0182.md",frontmatter:{title:"Friday, November 11"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0182.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
