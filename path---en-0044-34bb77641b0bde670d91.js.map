Under the planned economic system, the management of social and economic development by the political system is mainly based on factor management, especially the management of material factors, and the management is completed through the specific planning and distribution of specific material elements. Under the model of the market economic system, the political system can no longer do elemental management. If this is the case, the establishment of a market economic system will not have the necessary premise. The elements will be distributed through the market. The most typical examples are mechanisms such as metal exchanges, food exchanges, stock exchanges, and coal exchanges. The elements are properly circulated here. In addition to maintaining the necessary control (in order to ensure a smooth transition of the system), the political system no longer manages the elements.

Under the traditional system, the management of economic activities by the political system is basically internal management, that is, government agencies directly enter the entire production process and the management of the transaction process. To put it bluntly, the government has become the manager of the super-enterprise group, the whole country. The various companies form a super-enterprise group that operates under government operations. Obviously, no government can adapt to such management because the government and political system are ultimately made up of people, and people's potential is limited. Such a large-scale enterprise group, do not say that the whole operation under the well-organized plan is that it is not easy to maintain in general. The key is that \\\"established behavior is constrained\\\". This is the external management of the political system.

Production, circulation, exchange to distribution, from individual birth, employment to welfare and living conditions, comprehensive insurance. Under such a system, efficiency efficiency cannot be an indicator of major economic development and social development. The political system has direct and ultimate responsibility for the existence and development of all units and individuals. This broad and direct responsibility relationship prevents the political system from transcending economic direct management and micro-management.
