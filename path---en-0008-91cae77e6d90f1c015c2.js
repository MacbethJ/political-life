There seems to be a little understanding of me inside. She said that I want to help her with the materials. I said that I can't provide them. Because there are moral problems in this area, I can't join the camp of such articles. Otherwise, it will become a kind of self-proclaimed, no matter what kind of information, no. This is a consistent principle of life. However, this thing of F Jun is a bit like writing a picture that is difficult for ordinary people to understand. Wen said: Wang Huning may not be a homogeneous whole, but a changing whole, he constantly innovates himself and eliminates himself. He also said that he is a very rational person, and he is very rational at all times and will not be emotional. is it?</p>\n<p>People living in this world: some are weak; some are strong; some want others to set goals, some set goals for others; some need emotional support for life, and some need will to support life.
