All the years have passed in such an atmosphere. In the warm and colorful changes in society, people's subjectivity has also changed. The environment has transformed people, and people have also transformed the environment. Living in China today is probably the period when the subjectivity of the individual is most likely to change. Because China’s society has undergone the most profound changes in its history, China’s environment has undergone unprecedented changes.</p>\n<p>The deepest feeling is that life consumes a lot. This clear awareness of life is probably due to the sense of crisis towards old age. There seems to be no sense of life in my teenage years. Everything is spent in the water. I almost drowned in the pond when I was swimming. I didn't have any fear of life. Nowadays, the consciousness of life is becoming stronger and stronger, and it may be the logic that human beings cannot escape.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I think that the greatest fear of people comes from life consciousness. There is no fear of life without consciousness. The existence of life is the last condition of human fear.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the greatest happiness of a person comes from life. Without life, there is no happiness. The existence of life is the last condition of human happiness.</p>\n<p>All people living in this world actively or passively want to find a balance between these two conditions, and thus there are different divisions of people. Happiness or fear, life is always lost. It is a valuable life to realize your own ideals and wills in the process of loss of life and to complete people's choices. History is in the past year and year, and life is decreasing day by day.</p>\n<p>This is true for individuals, but for the entire human race, history is extended year by year, and life is increasing day by day.</p>\n<p>The individual is reduced in the overall increase, and the whole is increased in the individual reduction. We understand ourselves and society, and leaving this understanding will reduce the happiness we should have.
