The average person goes to Badaling, while Mutianyu goes less.</p>\n<p>Huairou used to be a poor county, and now the economy is developing. The county has a long terrain and 90% is mountainous. The situation in the mountains is relatively backward. When you are close to the Great Wall, there is a deep feeling that the natural environment is particularly good, and the green vegetation is lush and continuous, making you feel refreshed. In the county party committee, they said that this year the county party committee seized one thing. Through social and government support, the primary school students in the mountainous areas were concentrated to go to school, and basically scattered mountain schools were eliminated. Grasping education is a fundamental event.</p>\n<p>Go to the Mutianyu Great Wall and take the cable car up. It is indeed more dangerous, and the appearance remains relatively original. The mountains are flying with flags, and some farmers dressed as ancient soldiers stand on top, with ancient colors. It is a pity that the fog is difficult to see the distant scene, otherwise it must be very pleasant. It's a bit like \"the inside and outside of the Great Wall, only Yu Yu.\"</p>\n<p>On the Hongluo Temple, it is said that there was a master ancestor here. Compared with the Great Temple, the Hongluo Temple is less famous. An old abbot came to introduce and said a big pass. The ancient and modern China and foreign countries have joined together, and reform and opening up have never been forgotten. There is a saying that everyone laughs and laughs: \"I don't forget the old things, but I can't do anything new. It's not good to reform people. Isn't Ma Shengli Lu Guanqiu and others?\"</p>\n<p>The monk is also open.</p>",id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0144.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0144.md",frontmatter:{title:"September 3 Saturday"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0144.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
