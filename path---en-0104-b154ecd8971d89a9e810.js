In an oversized society like China, the grassroots organization of the ruling party is crucial. The ruling party is basically characterized by mastering power and organizing social life, especially in rural areas. Therefore, there will be a crisis if there is no grassroots organization to regulate the whole society. In rural areas, such a challenge is already in front of us and should be seized. In Western countries, although there is generally no grassroots party organization in this sense, in the election, the power of the organization has penetrated into every constituency and played a role for most people. In normal times, the backbone of the party and activists grasp the power of society and the resources of the society.</p>\n<p>The party is a vertical control system of Chinese society, and it is also a stable system and a coordination system. There must be a complete system of political parties, a system that is efficient, low-cost, and clean, and that goes deep into the public. So consider adding the chapter "Party and Government" to the "Government in the Post-Revolution Society".</p>\n<p>With regard to the contingent of cadres, there must first be specialized and politicians, especially politicians, to assume leadership responsibilities in a large country, to lead more than one billion people to modernize, and groups without politicians cannot imagine. A province or city may have a population of other countries, even more. Therefore, there should be politicians in these places. What is a politician? It should be a belief in death, a knowledge of Sino-Western knowledge, a personality of high mountains, a forward-looking vision, perseverance, perseverance, the ability to grasp the whole world, and so on. China\'s democratic revolution relies on an outstanding group of leaders. It is also needed now.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0104.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0104.md",frontmatter:{title:"Thursday, June 2"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0104.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
