It can also be said to be the concept of "introduction." Entrusted to organize the development of Shanghai in this year\'s political field. In order to do this, the basic skill is to clean up the newspapers this year and arrange the big things. In summary, there are a few points:</p>\n<p>Leader\'s personnel changes</p>\n<p>Progress in establishing the legal system of socialist market economy</p>\n<p>Fully cultivate scientific decision-making system in decision-making system and promote "cohesion engineering" with local characteristics</p>\n<p>Strengthening the fight against corruption according to central deployment</p>\n<p>Extensive expansion of external relations</p>\n<p>This kind of yearbook can not fully express its meaning in one book and one time. It depends on a series. After ten or twenty years, its value will be great. As a catalogue of historical development records, pictures are more valuable than words. Today, a Shanghai map that is even better printed will not be of much value, and a 19th-century map of Shanghai, no matter how rough, has value. This is the "cultural interest" given by history.</p>\n<p>The problem is that today\'s people can\'t wait for this "cultural interest" because the time to wait often exceeds the life of the person. And when a kind of interest exceeds the life of a person, will people still pursue it? Does man still have the motivation to pursue it? The human being is an animal that pursues immediate interests. The long-term interests are often not from rationality, but from accident. For cultural relics excavated from the ground, the buried people do not expect the "cultural interest" of history, but the interests of "present". The digging person gets "cultural interest", not because of history, but because of the present.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0184.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0184.md",frontmatter:{title:"Sunday on November 13th"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0184.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
