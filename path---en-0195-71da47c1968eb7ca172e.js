The improvement and reform of the political system, fundamentally speaking, is also to achieve more effective and more effective implementation of overall regulation of social development, promote social development, and promote the achievement of established political goals and social development goals.</p>\n<p>After the political system withdraws from the direct management of economic and social development, it needs to achieve a new political supply. The output of the political system is crucial to social development. The amount of energy supplied by politics depends on the size of political resources. In an oversized society, the power and authority of the political system depend to a large extent on the resources that it can master and allocate. In a small country, the political system has low requirements for mastering and allocating resources. It is not so political, and the technical factors are higher than the political ones. The political system has a certain amount or a considerable amount of resources, and is distributed according to the trend of social development and the goal of political development. It is the inevitable development of a big country and a necessary condition for a big country to maintain political integration. In a large society like China and a developing society, the political system must master and allocate the necessary amount of social resources.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the basic goal of the political system is to establish a reasonable new institutional structure on the one hand, and to put the resources that are gradually transferred to society and the market under the general control of the society, of course, macro and indirect regulation; Look for new growth points for political resources and increase political resources from new sources.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0195.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0195.md",frontmatter:{title:"Saturday, November 26"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0195.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
