Written: \"People live in this world, spend their lives, and get to know thousands of people. Some of these people pass by, some get along with each other. Some people, every day with you Together, but you don't have any impression of him. Some people occasionally meet you, but you can remember. Mr. Hao belongs to the latter kind, I only met him twice, but he stayed with me forever. In his heart, he bid farewell to us, left the world, left the cause he founded and cultivated, but he did not leave us.</p>\n<p>\"China has a lofty position in the soul of Mr. Hao. The most unbearable thing about him is that the Chinese can't. I don't know much about him, but I heard that the Chinese are smart and capable, and China is not in the world. In other countries, there are definitely many times. I have heard him say with excitement: 'We are all part of the Chinese nation. History, culture and feelings are cohesive. Olympics China has gold medals. All Chinese are Excited. I was very excited. 'This is a natural expression of the Chinese people's emotions. There is no such thing as a contrived. Only in the hardships and hardships of China's twentieth century, people who have climbed and climbed can understand the power of the Chinese nation. What it means.</p>\n<p>\"'Hao Ran Camp' is short-lived, but we all got something eternal. I remember that I said at the last day's meeting: 'This time I participated in Haoran Camp, I feel very deep, although I feel that both sides have profound problems on some issues. The differences, but after all, there is a lot of communication. My deepest feeling is that, when we have to look at the problem comprehensively, when we go to the country-style restaurant on the island opposite the restaurant, the car drives through the long bridge and sees the front. It’s a bleak, no tall building, only a low house, I think Macau is just like this. However, when we came back, at night, when we crossed the bridge, we saw that the tall building was standing tall and bright, and suddenly felt that it was not feeling just now. Comprehensive, so the reason is to see</p>\n<p>The problem is comprehensive. The second feeling was that we went to a Portuguese-style restaurant to use the last supper, and everyone drank a lot of wine. I was a little drunk and quietly left. I didn't say drunk the next day. But a camper was very frank. In the morning, he said that he was drunk yesterday. He opened the door at night and climbed to bed. I suddenly felt that I was not honest enough. The problem is also the same. There is no shortcoming. The problem is that you must be honest, you can’t be good, and others are shortcomings. These two feelings are the most valuable lessons I have learned in the Haoran camp. They are inexhaustible for me to think about myself and the world in the future. 'I don't know if this experience is what Mr. Hao expects. I think that people's gains in epistemology are far greater than the amount of income that he might get in other ways.</p>\n<p>\"Mr. Ho is engaged in the construction industry and has a reputation in this respect. When I was in Taipei, the car passed the Yuanshan Hotel. They introduced me to the Yuanshan Bridge. It was not easy to build such a bridge many years ago. The mainland of Zhongxiaodong Road The building is neat and majestic, and the building level is world-class. I have been to some cities in the world, such as New York, Washington, Paris, Tokyo, etc. The mainland building is not inferior, it was established 20 years ago. Another point is The strange thing is that compared with the colorful lighting advertisements of other buildings in Zhongxiao East Road, the mainland building looks clean and solemn, and it is very characteristic. It is said that Mr. Hao insists on this style, and it is very noisy and simple, very like Mr. Hao’s personality. .</p>\n<p>\"The empty mountain is not seen, but the human voice is heard. Mr. Hao's famous saying is: 'People must live with self-respect and pride.' I don't know much about Mr. Zhihao, but based on this limited understanding, I think He did it.\"</p>",id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0142.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0142.md",frontmatter:{title:"Wednesday, August 31"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0142.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
