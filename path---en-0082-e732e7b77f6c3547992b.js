This is a major issue that needs to be studied to relate to the fate of China and the stability of people\'s lives. The book is accessible, and the main question for visitors seems to be focused on whether China will be chaotic. The answers are totally different. If Professor Y thinks that there is a possibility of chaos, after a "strongman politics" is over, whether a new strongman can be produced is crucial. Professor X believes that there will be no chaos, and China\'s reform and opening up has entered the normalization track.</p>\n<p>I am afraid we have to study this issue. We must pay attention to the four major systems: the military, political parties, cadres and intellectuals. As long as the four systems do not have problems, China can develop steadily. Of course, there are many aspects of "black box". How to look at it is not easy. If the "black box" is turned into a "box", the problem is institutionalized.</p>\n<p>Study the documents of the 1979 and 1980 periods. At that time, the "Cultural Revolution" was just over, and the party\'s construction was more and more learned from the abnormal political life in the Cultural Revolution. And the documents at that time have been talked about more thoroughly. The key is practice and implementation. "Several Guidelines for the Party\'s Political Life" is a very systematic document. It is the most in-depth discussion of democratic centralism and party members themselves. It was also the request put forward by that era. Deng Xiaopingâ€™s 1980 article on the reform of the party and state system was the most profound one. The current article is also incomprehensible. How to have new ideas, perhaps the main thing is not the discussion of principles, but to propose new ideas, that is, to institutionalize the principles. At that time, the goal of "democratization, standardization, order, and discipline" was also put forward.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0082.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0082.md",frontmatter:{title:"Wednesday, April 27th"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0082.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
