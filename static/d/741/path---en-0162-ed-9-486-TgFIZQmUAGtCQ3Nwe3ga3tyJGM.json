{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Looking at the \"Schindler's List\" in the early morning is a work that can shock the soul. The shocking place is not its artistic and technical (of course there are many praises in this respect), but the world of humanity it reveals. The story reflects the tragedy that occurred in Poland during the Second World War, where the German army cruelly ruled and killed the Jews there. The Jewish nation lives in a strong death threat. A German businessman named Schindler used his own money to bribe the German officers, protecting a considerable number of Jews and not being sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp. Seeing the German slaughter (the real slaughter) unarmed Jews, seeing the violence of the Germans is so cruel, the soul can not be shocked. War and fanaticism, or power and ignorance, have caused them to lose their humanity. Faced with a living person, they were able to shoot at the head of the gun without looking at the pistol. In the face of the blood spewing out, they are indifferent and may feel pleasure. This is the greatest tragedy of mankind in the 20th century.</p>\n<p>The most profound part of this tragedy, the more cruel place than the death of millions of souls, is the annihilation of more humanity. Because only humanity is annihilated, there will be such a rare tragedy. The fascist rulers are of course the culprit, but those without humanity are the basis of their rule and brutality.</p>\n<p>The more terrible thing is: human beings often cannot be enlightened from cruel history. In today's world, isn't there still a living life that has passed away in war every day?</p>","id":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0162.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0162.md","frontmatter":{"title":"Wednesday, October 19"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0162.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}
