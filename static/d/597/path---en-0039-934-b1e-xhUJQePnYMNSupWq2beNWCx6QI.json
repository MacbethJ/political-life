{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Reading a novel by a German writer in the early morning, telling the story of a person posing as a person and living with his wife for 30 years. Of course it is a story.</p>\n<p>Read a book on the new tax system and get a preliminary understanding of the new tax system. The newly added value-added tax is an important tax type and is of great significance to the economic development of the whole country and the improvement of the central financial capacity. The income tax has also been sorted out and is now more clear.</p>\n<p>The shortcoming of the book is that it does not say the importance of the tax-sharing system, nor does it say what the tax-sharing system is. This is an important step in this tax reform. It is a reform that is more important than all other tax reforms. It is a reform that has the most basic meaning for China's future development. Also look for a book to study. Under the conditions of the tax-sharing system, what kind of new contradictions will there be to the relationship between the central and local governments. Any kind of reform will always create new contradictions while solving some old contradictions. Then people have to work hard to solve new contradictions. Society is progressing in this process.</p>","id":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0039.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0039.md","frontmatter":{"title":"Tuesday, February 22nd"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0039.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}
