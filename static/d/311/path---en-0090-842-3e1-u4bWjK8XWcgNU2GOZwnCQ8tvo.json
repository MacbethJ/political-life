{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Have breakfast with a Japanese scholar at the Japan International Forum, at an Italian restaurant. During the period, I talked about some issues and summarized them as follows:</p>\n<p>The recent incident of the Minister of Justice, Nagano, on the attitude of the \"Nanjing Massacre\" essentially reflects the views of some Japanese politicians on this issue. However, under the pressure of the international community, the ruling coalition government cannot make concessions and let Yongye step down. . A friend of Yongye said that Yongye fell into the trap set by some reporters opposed to him in Japan. The reporter deliberately let Yongye say such a thing. Yongye said that so many people killed by the Japanese army in Nanjing are a fiction. But admitted the \"Nanjing Massacre.\" The newspaper reported that Yongye denied the \"Nanjing Massacre\" itself. This may also be an explanation. In any case, this incident reflects that many Japanese high-level people have no deep understanding of this issue.</p>","id":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0090.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0090.md","frontmatter":{"title":"Sunday, May 15th"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0090.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}
