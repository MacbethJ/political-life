The meeting adopted the \"Decision on Strengthening Several Major Issues in Party Building.\" The \"Decision\" put forward the goals and tasks of party building in the new era, and proposed to regard party building as a great project in the new era. The \"Decision\" proposes: under the conditions of the changing world, in the great changes of contemporary China's reform, opening up, and modernization, the party is built to be armed with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, to serve the people wholeheartedly, and to ideological politics. A Marxist party that is fully consolidated in the organization, able to withstand various risks, and always in the forefront of the times.</p>\n<p>This is a \"decision\" with significant practical and historical significance. The cause that China has carried out is unprecedented, and it is both great and extremely difficult. Reforming and building a large country with a population of 1.2 billion and a relatively backward level of socio-economic development will not only face the heavy burden left over by history, but also face new situations, new contradictions and new problems caused by extensive and profound changes. The task of developing social productive forces, developing socialist spiritual civilization, establishing a socialist market economy, and further improving the material and cultural living standards of the people is still very arduous and complicated. The requirements and tasks put forward by reform and construction, such as handling the relationship between reform, development, and stability, transforming the internal management mechanism of state-owned enterprises, strengthening the foundation for the development of agricultural production, establishing a good market order, rectifying circulation and price order, and controlling currency. Inflating, establishing a reasonable distribution system, overcoming a certain degree of out-of-control, imbalance, anomie and disorder in the economic development, and establishing socialist democracy and the legal system are all very arduous. Negative corruption and ugliness are still plagued. we. If these different types of problems cannot be effectively handled, reform and construction will not proceed smoothly, and no further progress can be made.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the key is whether the ruling party is strong and capable of implementing strong leadership. The ruling party shoulders the heavy responsibility of history and has withstood the test of the times. It must strengthen its own construction and continuously improve its leadership and governance.</p>","id":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0149.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0149.md","frontmatter":{"title":"September 28th Wednesday"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0149.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}
