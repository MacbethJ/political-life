{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>At zero, TV puts a French film called \"Ten Days of Confusion.\" I started to feel boring. It was because of the French film. I only looked patiently to understand a little French culture. Later I found out that it was a good movie. In French, it is L'APPETITVIENTENMANGEANG. It is a young man who has a mental illness and calls his teacher to his home in the country. The family is rich, the father is the adoptive father, the wife is young. He had an affair with his wife, and the father actually knew it. He used various methods to torture them.</p>\n<p>Finally, the wife was killed and the students committed suicide. The appearance is that the student killed the wife. After analysis, the teacher is probably a Freudian analysis, and found that the real murderer is the adoptive father. Because the adoptive father is to play the role of God. There is a certain cultural \"depth\", not a simple story display.</p>\n<p>I saw the pirated copy of the \"Shicheng Tongue War\" discovered in Wuhan, rough. Add \"Bell's technicalist political thought\" and \"Toffler's futuristic political thought\" in the course of \"Modern Western Political Thought\". The political thoughts of the two represent the direction of the development of post-industrial society, and have a more detailed analysis of the social, cultural and psychological conflicts caused by industrialization, and have implications for countries that are modernizing. Bell has more criticisms of capitalist society. Although Toffler also said that the current capitalist system is not suitable for future development, it is not a criticism but a historical transcendence.</p>\n<p>In \"Selection of Western Political Classics\", add Habermas's \"Communication and Social Progress\", Weber's \"Protestant Ethic and Capitalism\", Dahl's \"Dilemma of Diversified Democracy\", Nozick's \"None Government, State and Utopia. These books are updated as part of the original book. The problem is that it is often not easy to find a book, only in a Chinese version of the book.</p>","id":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0038.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0038.md","frontmatter":{"title":"Monday, February 21"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0038.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}
