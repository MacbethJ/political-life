{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>In the afternoon, I went to the two furniture stores in Lingfangyuan and Shiliupu to buy a table for dinner. In the furniture city of Shiliupu, I saw a lot of furniture. The result was a fancy oak dining table produced in a place in Guangdong. The price written on it was 2,100 yuan and the chair was 370 yuan. We observed there, a middle-aged man came over, very enthusiastic, saying that if you want this table, you can make a discount and fold. This is of course much cheaper. I was very surprised when I heard that I was able to play as much as 8.5 fold! Then I suddenly thought that there was something \"cat hiding\" inside. I decided to go to another store and read it. To Hualian, the same table as long as 1400 yuan, you can also play 10% off, the chair is 270 yuan. The face is lighter than ash, not oak, as long as 1,200 yuan. This is a sudden realization, no wonder that the person said that the new face is lighter, and happy to give us a discount, if bought, he can still make huge profits.</p>\n<p>Such things have to be managed. If the merchants do this, the ordinary people are not going to run their legs, and they are not sure whether the things they buy are at a reasonable price level. The market economy must have rules that must be conducive to the lives of ordinary people. Otherwise, where is the rationality of the market economy? Just for the merchants to make a fortune? I am afraid this is the reason why the market economy cannot be proved at the most.</p>","id":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0177.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0177.md","frontmatter":{"title":"Saturday, November 5th"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0177.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}
