Just reading "The Stagnation of Empire", combined, it is very interesting: "Stop of the Empire" when Western countries just began to compete for the market and colonies to the East, but after the twentieth century, it is already within the Western countries for the colonies and markets Start the stage of intense struggle. Nietzsche is already calling for "superman" to establish a new order. How ruthless is the development of history. In the international community, if you do not advance, you will retreat. However, to the point of Nietzsche\'s madness, it is probably a disaster. It is not only a personal disaster, but also a national disaster.</p>\n<p>We have a meeting of the review of the "Suichuan Liangyi Fund" project in the center of Japan. A total of 28 issues were reported this year and 19 were approved. At the same time, a scholarship for 31 students, worth 2,500 yuan, is a better scholarship in the school. I suggest that such a large scholarship should be sent in a monthly manner. Otherwise, the cost of the scholarship is too high. About one-fifth of the money may be "squeezed out". The so-called "hospitality". This is the Chinese culture. At this time, everyone can "squeeze" and cannot refuse. This is also a kind of big pot rice mentality, because getting more things than others is reasonably "unreasonable" and eats more than others, so it is necessary to "please", otherwise it will not be a human being.</p>\n<p>Open a department meeting to discuss how the wages decided are issued. This is also a Chinese characteristic. 70% of the salary of the school decides that it is necessary to decide what to do in the department. Of course, the best way is to make a big pot of rice, otherwise how to offend people. If you want to come and think, go with 70%. 30% of the money is not much, but the face is priceless.</p>\n<p>There was a continuous accident. First, a cruise ship in Qiandao Lake caught fire in the past few days and burned 24 Taiwanese. It is also unclear why. Today, another ship has turned over and more than 40 primary school students have died. The concept of life is not the first in many people\'s consciousness. It is probably too many people in the past and not worth the money. The Chinese have long said that life is a matter of life, and now it seems to have become a fortune.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0070.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0070.md",frontmatter:{title:"Thursday, April 7th"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0070.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
