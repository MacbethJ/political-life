Americans are too technical, especially do not understand political art, very pragmatic. In the previous paragraph, the basic judgments of the American academic and political circles probably believed that China did not have much use, and there was no glorious prospect in the economy. It was politically in a transitional period, so it was very tough against China. I want to change China's policies through various pressures. However, a country's policies are often linked to the basic interests of the country and to the development path of a society. They cannot be changed at will. American tactics are done in a variety of technical ways. Chinese culture has traditionally not dealt with politics in this way, but more emphasis on political art, especially on sensitive issues. After China's economy develops, when China does not make more concessions, when the United States needs China, Americans cannot afford to give in. When the United States wants to make concessions, it is still seeking steps, and the result is still technicalism or pragmatism. In this way, dealing with a big Eastern country can't be effective. The United States has many lessons in Asia, and Americans will probably learn slowly.</p>\n<p>Politics often has two viewpoints, one is technicalism, the most typical of the United States; the other is artism, and some countries in Asia are the most typical. If you can't have a deep understanding of culture and history, especially the spiritual world of people, it is not easy to reach a consensus.</p>",id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0108.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0108.md",frontmatter:{title:"Tuesday, June 7"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0108.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
