The main thoughts are:</p>\n<p>In advancing new and great projects, the party must be good at understanding itself, strengthening itself, improving itself in the new situation of reform and opening up, and earnestly studying and resolving the conditions of new contradictions and new problems encountered in its own construction in the flourishing development of Chinese society. Next, the ruling party must constantly do its own construction and strengthen and improve the party's leadership. In a big country like China, it is necessary to unify the thinking and strength of 1.2 billion people to promote reform and construction. Without a highly unified party leadership, it cannot be conceived. In the process of profound social change, it is impossible to construct such a party without constantly improving and improving itself while actively changing society.</p>\n<p>Comrade Mao Zedong particularly emphasized that in order to ensure victory, the party must solve the problem of \"how to know ourselves, strengthen ourselves, and unite ourselves.\" In 1938, he clarified this principle in the \"Status of the Chinese Communist Party's National War\". Now, he should know himself, strengthen himself, and improve himself in the reality of reform and opening up. This is a requirement for the deepening of reform and opening up, and it is also a requirement for our party to improve its subjective state. For more than a decade, reform and opening up have injected new vitality into the party's construction, and have enabled the party's construction to gain strong momentum from practice. At the same time, the partyâ€™s historical mission is to place higher and higher demands on party building. The party must constantly improve its leadership and governance levels to adapt to the ever-changing objective situation. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said that it is not a true Marxist to inherit and develop Marxism without new ideas and viewpoints. Marxist parties must study new situations, analyze new problems, propose new ideas, and formulate new theories. Otherwise, it will lag behind the pace of development of the times and the interests of the people, so that the party can not truly win the support of the people, and it cannot be truly consolidated under the conditions of constant renewal.</p>",id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0151.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0151.md",frontmatter:{title:"September 30th Friday"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0151.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
