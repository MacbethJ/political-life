The record is as follows:</p>\n<p>\"Dear teacher:</p>\n<p>Although I have written a variety of applications for membership, joining the party, and enlisting. It has never been as solemn as this one, because this time it is the intrinsic value that it once possesses.</p>\n<p>I have thirty-six this year. It seems that I should not fight against young people, but I can't resist the temptation to read. I remember when I graduated from junior high school, my mother asked me to drop out of school because of family difficulties. For this reason, I had a quarrel with my mother. On the eve of applying for graduate students, the political commissar of the time also repeatedly discouraged me because I was facing the expansion of the time. I was the natural candidate of the director. After weighing, I chose to study.</p>\n<p>Why do you want to study again? Someone asked me this way, and I asked myself this way. Although it is not difficult to compose some grandiose answers, this is not my character. So, is it 'Shishi'? As a group officer, the weight of the diploma is almost zero; or is it a name? I have won the 1987 National Reportage Special Award, the Excellent Prose Award, and the way to go as a writer seems to be More closely; or is it a job title? But it is useless to an administrative cadre.</p>\n<p>No need to ask any more questions. I think if it is necessary to get to the bottom, it may come from my experience of life. Because I found that people look at a moral person, and the gaze is gracious.</p>\n<p>Looking at a person with power, the gaze is awe, only to look at a person with knowledge, only to see the infinite respect in the eyes, and full of sincere admiration. I yearn for that respect and admiration. Moreover, I really appreciate the quiet little world that can still be kept in the pages of noisy, complicated and floating noise.</p>\n<p>Teachers, pray that you will understand me, satisfying me may be a luxury but not a reasonable request \": read up.\"</p>\n<p>Itâ€™s really well written. If you can get such an understanding in the whole society, then society will develop and progress. Unfortunately, people often have to go through a lot of hard work to understand this.</p>",id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0167.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0167.md",frontmatter:{title:"October 25th Tuesday"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0167.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
