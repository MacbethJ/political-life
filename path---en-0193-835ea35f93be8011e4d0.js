Read it again, which reads:</p>\n<p>The policy of reform and opening up represents the most basic interests of the Chinese society and the Chinese nation. Practice has proved that reform and opening up is the only way for China's social modernization. China has been in a backward social and economic state since modern times, falling behind the general trend of the world. Due to economic backwardness, China has always been passive in international relations. The Chinese nation has suffered through hardships and wars in modern times. This situation has affected China's international status, affected the healthy development of Chinese society, and affected people's daily lives. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, economic strength developed rapidly, but for reasons that everyone knows, economic and social development has never become the center of social development. From the needs of historical and realistic development, China has chosen the road of reform and opening up to develop. The reform and opening up represents the most basic interests of the Chinese people and represents the most basic interests of the entire Chinese nation. Therefore, it is a historical point. It is a common choice.</p>\n<p>The policy of reform and opening up has received enthusiastic support from the Chinese people. The reform and opening up policy has brought about the most rapid development in China's history. China's social and economic development has undergone unprecedented changes, its comprehensive national strength has greatly improved, its economic power has greatly increased, and its people's living standards have improved rapidly. All of this has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and won the sincere support and support of all the people. The people from the bottom of their hearts are supporting the policy of reform and opening up. That is, Deng Xiaoping said: \"Doing not adhere to socialism, not reform and opening up, not developing the economy, and not improving people's lives can only be a dead end. Who must change the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session, and the people will not agree, who? It will be overthrown. \"The reform and opening up policy is already the will of the people, and the people are willing.</p>\n<p>The economic system and social system have entered a new mechanism. After years of reform and opening up, China has gradually established a new economic system and social system, and various social forces and elements have formed new combinations in the new mechanism. The circulation and operation of national economic and social management in this new mechanism is already a logic that cannot be changed at will. Otherwise, the entire national economy and social management will be seriously tilted and even have serious consequences. The distribution of social resources in Chinese society, the macro management of the government, the mode of economic operation, the structure of the economy, the coupling of economic relations at home and abroad, and the coordination of various social activities have all formed a system that is greatly different from the old system. This in itself is a powerful guarantee for reform and opening up.</p>\n<p>China’s leadership highly values ​​the path of reform and opening up. China's current cadre class, whether it is a central cadre or a provincial cadre, has undergone important changes in vision, experience, knowledge structure, and value orientation. Modernization and reform and opening up have formed a solid goal in their minds. They themselves have a deeper understanding of the world, have broader ideas for human development, have a better grasp of modern scientific knowledge, have a more modern awareness of managing the country, and have a stronger influence on the promotion of economic and social development. The pursuit. This is the basic organizational guarantee for China's modernization and reform and opening up.</p>",id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0193.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0193.md",frontmatter:{title:"Thursday, November 24th"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0193.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
