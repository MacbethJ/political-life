In Japan, it is a place outside the ocean.</p>\n<p>Go to the international forum and have formal activities. First, I interviewed reporters from Japan’s Asahi Shimbun and then discussed with the research team of Keio University in Japan about China’s political and social development. The questions they raised include: China\'s social economy is developing rapidly, can China maintain social stability? Will military spending continue to increase, and where is the increase in military spending mainly used? What is the relationship between central and local governments? In the direction of development, will local dispersalism affect the unity and integrity of the whole China? The situation on the Korean Peninsula is relatively tense. If the second Korean War occurs, what kind of position will China take? China has a paradox that Japan is the future of China. The "opponents", how big is this paradox in China? These questions are very sensitive issues, reflecting the main aspects of Japan\'s concern for Chinese politics. Of course, the starting point of some problems is not appropriate, and there is a strong subjective color. However, they are indeed studying and believe that these issues will affect China\'s development and affect future Sino-Japanese relations.</p>\n<p>In the evening, a report was held at the ANA Hotel. There were Japanese congressmen, researchers from big companies, big entrepreneurs and university professors. The topic of my speech is "China\'s Future and Asian Security: Implications for Japan." Discuss after the talk. The questions raised in the discussion are: One of the major problems in China\'s economic development is to control inflation. At present, China has the ability to control inflation. Whether the rapid rise in prices is likely to be controlled; China does not seem to pay much attention to environmental protection in the process of economic development. This will affect the sustained development of the Chinese economy. Does China have any specific countermeasures and overall strategy for this issue? China seems to be still "managing the country", and it cannot be said that it is a legal state. Is there a complete plan for the construction of the legal system? Not in the primary position, the Japanese business community is currently afraid to invest in China. This is a big factor; China’s national security concept is unclear; recently China and Russia have strengthened their ties, and the future development will be How should we establish a trusting relationship with Japan at this time and not be hostile to Japan; what is China’s view on Japan’s struggle to become a permanent member of the Security Council; China is increasingly participating in the international community, but the international community is now an interdependent society and a national sovereignty. Put forward different views, China’s national sovereignty There is no theory of development.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0091.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0091.md",frontmatter:{title:"Monday, May 16th"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0091.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
