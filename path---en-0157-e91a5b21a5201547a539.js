webpackJsonp([18651624894432],{1306:function(e,t){e.exports={data:{markdownRemark:{html:'<p>Reading "China is thinking about who is an ugly Chinese" is a cynical book that has an indignant description and sigh of all kinds of problems in Chinese society, such as the annihilation of human nature, the shackles of corruption, the official residence of officials, and so on. It can be said that the author is boldly writing, boldly angry, and boldly appealing. Of course, this is an imaginary book, and it is unrealistic to do more rational analysis.</p>\n<p>Proofreading the proof of "Principles of Political Marxist Political Science", I feel that I have done my best to discover new things and refine a system of general systems.</p>\n<p>The outline of the doctoral program "Chinese Society and Politics" is organized, and twelve topics are listed as the central discussion topic. The education of doctoral students should be based on heuristics and research. The main topics listed this time are:</p>\n<p>The historical orientation of China\'s social politics. The development model of Chinese society. The comparison between Chinese and Western political development. The comparison between Chinese and Western political development and political culture. The comparison of political development in contemporary China. The relationship between China\'s political power and the reorganization of the Chinese Communist Party\'s leadership and self-improvement. Model and road reform and opening up and the evolution of political ideology. The optimization of market economic system and social regulation mode. The role of civil society and national government in economic marketization. The relationship between central and local governments. The grassroots level of stable social development in the process of China\'s modernization. Network Reconstruction of China\'s Regional Economic Development and Political Balance. The Development of China\'s Social Power Structure in the 1990s. Chinese Politics Meeting the Challenge of the 21st Century</p>\n<p>Participants are required to study carefully on each of the central discussion topics and to speak in class. Each topic will introduce five relevant reference materials, including books and papers, to the whole person. Each topic selects one person as the organizer of the discussion, and the results of the whole discussion are processed into documents.</p>\n<p>Tuesday, Tuesday</p>\n<p>Turn over the proofs of the book "Logic of Politics" to prevent serious mistakes, both in typesetting and in theoretical discourse. The accuracy of such theoretical books is first, because it is to discuss some thinkers\' ideology, not our own ideas, nor do we use their ideas to talk about problems. In general, we have reached our original intention of arranging the political ideas of the founders of Marxist theory into a principled system. Although preliminary, it may be first and valuable.</p>\n<p>When I came back in the evening, I saw a lot of dark things on the open space in the five districts of Liangcheng. The lights were very dim, and those things were staggering and staggering in the wind. When I came closer, I knew that it was a unique "building" in a big city, a stall made of broken iron, wood and tarpaulin. Most of these are stalls that buy big cake fritters, noodles, or something in the morning. When it comes in the morning, it is even more chaotic, the voice is noisy, the sound is constantly selling, the breath is weird, and it is often unbearable. However, people silently huddled and watched inside, seemingly not waking up from a night\'s sleep, and were indifferent to all of this. These vendors seem to gradually give way to the "foreign legion." People from all over the world, all kinds of people, live a happy life here, earn their hard money from the wallet in the city. The counterfeit and shoddy products here are unimpeded. Whatever Huangqiao Biscuits, Lanzhou Ramen, Beijing Flavor Egg Rolls, and Shandong Flatbreads, there is a lot of "trademark awareness". In fact, the reputation of these things is the best trademark. When the market economy has not yet developed, I don’t know where they are going. If someone first registers, what will happen? Perhaps this registration can’t stop it. Thousands of people continue to make things like "Huangqiao Biscuits", so they are useless.</p>\n<p>The biggest problem is the challenge of management; the first is how to manage this piece of "village in the city", and the second is how to manage the residents in this village. It seems that there is no rule at present, just to collect some taxes. Those broken "buildings" are such a hindrance to the city\'s view; those children who are snarling in the nose are obviously telling a phenomenon that violates the national policy; those who automatically form gangs sometimes It is such a way of "deliberately scorning the law"; is there any way? If there is no way, it means that modernization is late. This problem is faced in all modern and developing societies. This problem cannot be solved effectively, as if we were riding a fast-moving vehicle, but none of us would drive it. This car is modernization itself.</p>\n<p>Wednesday, Wednesday</p>\n<p>Reading "North of the City" said that two well-known directors are vying to adapt it into a movie, probably also an advertising effect. I don\'t know if the author written on the cover wrote that there are too many fake things, and I really can\'t believe it. The story is probably happening in any city in the south of the Yangtze River. The background is the "Cultural Revolution", and then the things of men and women, interspersed with the spiritual state of the "Cultural Revolution" period. The description of the story is more "poetic", more abstract, as if it is a sense of sentimental form, or the true rush of the author\'s stream of consciousness. It is not completely realistic, and people feel that everything seems to be exaggerated. It cannot be corresponding in reality, but it is possible. This is probably a modern style.</p>\n<p>Thursday, Thursday</p>\n<p>Friendship restaurant, some people treat. I ordered a crab, 200 yuan a, it is simply "scare" the dead. Somehow, this crab is just like this. The development of society is often carried out in an incomprehensible logic. I remember when I was young, this crab was a few cents a pound. It seems that there are not many people to eat. At that time, I liked the semiconductor radio, and I installed it myself. I ran off my calf and bought cheap parts in Niuzhuang Road and Fuzhou Road. I still think it is an astronomical number. But after these years have passed, they have changed. Semiconductors can\'t be cheaper, and a set of "very strong" audio equipment, but 600 yuan. And a crab, but it costs 200 yuan. I think that the children in the remote mountainous areas are guilty of reading books. I hope that the efforts of the project will not dare to say that I have eaten. I dare not think about it. Mr. Lu Xun said that the first person to eat crabs is very courageous. Now, the last person who eats crabs is also very courageous.</p>\n<p>I was thinking that the waiter had four "medium" crabs coming up, burning red and putting them neatly. Then I started to eat, and when I ate one side, I had a huge question: How did it cost 200 yuan? Pick each piece of meat from the corners of the corner, after all. This problem has not been figured out. It can only be: the logic of social development is sometimes illogical. First, things are rare, and now they have more people. They can\'t help but have a national mouth, and they have natural mouths, which are naturally expensive. Second, things are rare. This theorem is more useful today. When the crab is sold for 200 yuan, it is the dish of the guest, which is the true love of the "big money" and "big wrist". If you buy a few dollars, it is absolutely impossible to take it. Nowadays, many people\'s psychology is like this. Cheap things can\'t be sold, as long as they increase the price, and they have to be added to the astronomical figures, but they are rushing. When a pair of trousers is sold for 10,000 yuan, no one buys it. And the 10 yuan in the stalls near the school sold five Meijiajing toothpaste, it seems that no one bought it. That is too cheap, far below the average consumer benchmark.</p>\n<p>For a period of time, society always "creates" something that is surprisingly so as to satisfy people\'s psychological needs. One day, when the pig\'s ear is sold for 500 yuan or two, don\'t feel inexplicable.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0157.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0157.md",frontmatter:{title:"Monday, October 10"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0157.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
