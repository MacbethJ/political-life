This chapter analyzes what changes have taken place in society after the reform and opening up, and what challenges these reforms pose to the reform of the government system. The ten major changes in the government administration of the six major changes in the social field were enriched. At the same time, there is a gap between the two sets of variables. This gap is the starting point for examining the reform of the government system:</p>\n<p>First, the gap between active and passive. The first set of variables is developing at a fast speed, spreads widely, and is a proactive aspect. The second group of variables develops slowly and the spread is relatively narrow, which is a passive aspect of change. This is in line with the laws of the development of the general society. Social development is always the most vivid and dynamic side, especially after various factors of society have been fully activated. The development of the government system can only be promoted and developed after people have reached a certain limit on the accumulated strength of social development.</p>\n<p>Second, the difference in time. From the point of view of time, there is such a gap in objectiveness. The process of social development, especially the process of economic development, always leads other developments in society. This feature will become more apparent after the market economy system has been gradually established. The reform of the government system can only be promoted after the economic power reaches a certain level, or the government system can have the driving force for development after the requirements of economic development. The gap in this time is sometimes not subjectively eliminated. The problem is to recognize this gap and try to reduce the gap. In a society with rapid economic development, this gap is easier to form.</p>\n<p>Third, the gap in recognition. What are the requirements for social development to the government system, and how the government system should adapt to social development and have problems with recognition. The objective requirements for social development are not recognizable by all. It is the ability to recognize, it will produce different results, and sometimes even the result of fierce opposition. The government system is a sensitive area, and its reform involves a total change. Therefore, people often have more differences on this issue. The society has developed, but it is not easy to promote the reform of the government system until people's recognition has not reached a certain level of agreement. The more rapidly developing society, the more difficult it is to form the commonality of recognition. The reason is the multi-directionality and multi-possibility of social development, which provides people with too many elements of recognition. The more development variables, the harder it is to recognize.</p>\n<p>Fourth, the gap in design. The reform of the government system requires a relatively complete design. It cannot be designed while changing. The logic of the government system is like this. Because once the government system is changing, its regulatory functions will be affected. Therefore, the reform of the government system requires a complete design, and the complete design needs to have sufficient control of the elements of change. In a rapidly changing society, different elements are changing all the time, and it is not easy to achieve a certain degree of certainty in a period. Without such a grasp, nature cannot make a reasonable design. On the other hand, there is no existing model for what kind of institutional model to adopt for the new system in China. China's historical social environment, China's social structure and social relations, and the socialist market economy system with Chinese characteristics need to adapt to what kind of government system is not a good answer. The overall design itself is in the process of exploration, and there will be such a gap.</p>\n<p>Fifth, the gap in operation. The biggest problem is the gap in operation. The government system can be said to be the central nerve of social regulation and is of vital importance. The reform of it should be based on the interests of the whole society and based on the stable development of the whole society. If the government's institutional reforms cause social instability or unrest, the cost is too high. Not only will the government system reform not be completed, but the economic development and modernization process may also be interrupted. China is a developing country, a \"super-large society\", and it is undergoing rapid changes. The government system bears a very important function: maintaining social stability and order. On the one hand, this function cannot be slack, on the other hand, it is necessary to change the system that undertakes this function. This is the operational gap. The economic system reform is much more operational. Although some important changes in the national economy and the people's livelihood are difficult to operate, the government system reform is generally difficult.</p>\n<p>Therefore, from the basic task of the development of the government system, how to narrow the gap between the two sets of variables.</p>",id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0100.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0100.md",frontmatter:{title:"Sunday on May 29th"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0100.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
