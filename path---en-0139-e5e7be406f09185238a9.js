A Taiwanese scholar published an article about the relationship between the central and local governments. He saw that there were many ideas and there was not much understanding of China. He analyzed that central concentration is prone to four problems:</p>\n<p>First, the central government allocates resources as a means of reward and punishment, and cannot rely on the principle of supply and demand to allocate rationally. Second, the central error must evolve into a national error; third, the local problem tends to rise to the central issue; fourth, the central organization expands and the affairs are complex. Inefficiency. At first glance, it seems to be very insightful, but I can't stand the scrutiny.</p>\n<p>I said that these four articles basically cannot be established: Article 1, developed countries also regard this as the basic method of regulating local government behavior, and our problem is precisely that it is not really used as a means of reward and punishment; Within the scope of power, such as political power, it is the same in all countries; Article 3, under a more centralized power system, local issues are often not easy to become national problems; Article 4, whether central concentration will inevitably lead to institutions Expansion is not inevitable. The key is to control the establishment of the organization itself. In the case of decentralization, the local institutions must expand, and they must each assume the affairs that the central government no longer manages. Of course, in order to think dialectically, if it is general, these reasons can also be said to exist.</p>\n<p>The Taiwan scholar's article has a model: the front is theoretical analysis, mostly the introduction of Western theory or concept, and then the analysis of practical problems. It seems that all types of academic articles have such characteristics, and whether the results of an education are not known.</p>",id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0139.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0139.md",frontmatter:{title:"Wednesday, August 24th"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0139.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
