Cultural expansionism has two manifestations:</p>\n<p>The first is the formation of the "cultural hegemony" strategy. After the Cold War, Western countries strengthened their efforts to use cultural power to constrain and influence world affairs and the development process within developing countries, because the "hard power", political, and military methods no longer apply. For example, the concept of human rights has become the main cultural factor that Western countries influence the internal political process in other countries. In a cultural system that has a different understanding of the concept of human rights, the problem will gradually rise to the political level and have political attributes. In practice, Western countries often use political means and other means to promote their value and exert political and economic pressure on developing countries. In the past, violence and political rule could be used to promote it. Nowadays, cultural expansionism is more cultural.</p>\n<p>Another form of expression of cultural expansionism is less intense. It can be said that it is not a vertical "cultural hegemony", that is, not imposing one\'s own culture on others, but a horizontal "cultural expansion", that is, expanding one The scope of culture is even extended to the fields of other countries, or the same nation that has already belonged to different countries in the territory is unified with culture. This "cultural expansion" exists to a certain extent, some and even very powerful, such as "pan-Slavicism", "Great Turkestan" and so on. Although this kind of "cultural expansion" is not politicized in the above form, it also poses a severe challenge to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of certain countries.</p>\n<p>With cultural expansionism, there will be cultural protectionism. The positive expression of cultural protectionism is "cultural sovereignty." Cultural sovereignty mainly presents two forms of performance in today\'s international society. One is total, that is, political entities with political sovereignty to maintain and strengthen their cultural sovereignty. This tendency mainly occurred in the developing countries. After the end of the Cold War, they encountered pressure from the culture of developed countries, mainly in political ideology, lifestyle and values. This trend makes culture more directly linked to sovereignty, and developing countries defend their own culture as defending sovereignty. At the same time, there has been such a sign for the developed countries.</p>\n<p>One of the trends of "cultural sovereignty" is that in the new international political landscape, more original secondary political entities have begun to demand "cultural sovereignty." After the pattern formed since the Second World War broke down, some political entities established after the war broke down, which constituted the basic phenomenon in the new political structure. For example, the former Soviet Union was broken down into several countries, Czechoslovakia was broken down into two countries, the former Yugoslavia was decomposed into multiple political entities, and a long-term bloody war was launched for this decomposition. As for other places, the tendency to demand cultural sovereignty was also In development. For example, the white extreme organization in South Africa now requires the establishment of its own independent "homeland", which means that culture and value are based on different architectures. The rise from demanding "cultural sovereignty" to demanding political sovereignty is a new trend in the development of international relations today.</p>\n<p>The above analysis shows that in the operation of international relations after the Cold War, the sensitivity of cultural factors in international relations has also increased greatly. Cultural factors will attract people\'s attention and cause major changes in international relations.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0057.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0057.md",frontmatter:{title:"Sunday on March 13"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0057.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
