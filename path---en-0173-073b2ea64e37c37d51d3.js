I said that we should pay attention to establishing our own position in history so that we can study the problem in more depth. We are all from history, and everyone cannot go beyond history to see problems. However, sometimes, transcending a little history makes sense for the profoundness of one\'s own thoughts. Since the 19th century, it has entered the historical period of Marxâ€™s invasion of the Western civilization into the East, making the reference system when we know our society has become Western. This is not something that we can get rid of, but a sediment of historical development. We live in this world and will receive it. The real breakthrough is to go beyond them. Hasn\'t Western civilization been influenced by the minor Asian civilization? Therefore, it can be hundreds of years.</p>\n<p>"Flicking a finger", and really analyzing the problem from science and reason. In this way, China will have a more thorough understanding of itself.</p>\n<p>Another point is the problem of logical analysis. A doctoral student boldly envisioned the difference between the basic spirit of Chinese and Western political philosophy, saying that "China\'s political philosophy is from public to private, recognizing the disharmony between man and nature, society, and the universe." Reasonable, and Western political philosophy is from private to public, recognizing that harmony between man and nature, society and the universe is not harmonious. "Summary and refined." The crux of the problem is that one must have the ability to generalize, and the second must have a logical speculative ability to argue. Such a proposition is basically a logic that needs to be argued. "From public to private", from private to public "Who is reasonable? There must be a logical explanation, and then a realistic argument. The overall trend now seems to be "from private to public". It can be said that this is the product of the Western way of understanding people and the world. The East is different, and it is different from the ideal human life. The problem is that we need a better logical argument.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0173.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0173.md",frontmatter:{title:"Monday, October 31"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0173.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
