Shanghai has achieved world-recognized achievements in the past three years. The city\'s appearance and economic development have undergone tremendous changes. Many old Shanghai and Shanghai have also lamented. People\'s mentality has been steadily in this rapid development process, which is an important atmosphere for social stability. What is going to be discussed now is how to do in Shanghai in the next three years? Everyone has a warm discussion, vivid opinions and creativity.</p>\n<p>The development of a modern metropolis should have two wings.

The Japanese have already had such a reference in the past few years. There must be new pursuits because we are already moving towards the new century.</p>\n<p>The changes that will take place in the new century are hard to imagine today.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0186.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0186.md",frontmatter:{title:"November 15th Tuesday"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0186.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
