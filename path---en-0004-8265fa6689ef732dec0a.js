The author\'s conclusion is that Zhou Enlai is not a handsome talent. It seems that the author thinks this is a breakthrough. Now that the "Altar" or "Altar" is prevalent, celebrities have gone down, and I don\'t know when to write anything. In real life, there will always be people who will go to the "altar".</p>\n<p>The general part of the politics of the "93 China Development Report" was written, and the political development in 1993 was summarized as "developing the political resources for promoting the socialist market economy." A new idea should be well demonstrated and a special article can be written later. The promotion of China\'s economic development and modernization requires a large amount of political resources, including institutional resources and policy resources. The development of Western countries has changed today and requires more economic and information resources than political resources. China\'s national conditions determine the political resources that need to be enriched. Also proposed the concept of "economic politics." It is estimated that for a long period of time, "economy politics" will be the main trend, and "economic politics" is both a subjective choice and an objective force. People cannot but choose or even resist. "Economic politics" is beneficial and has its drawbacks. The main drawback is that political authorities will be in a weak position and it will not be easy to reply in the future.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0004.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0004.md",frontmatter:{title:"Friday, January 7"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0004.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
