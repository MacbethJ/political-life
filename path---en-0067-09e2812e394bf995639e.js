One day, probably written. The basic point is:</p>\n<p>"Imperial", the term makes people feel a decadent and stale existence, letting people smell the old-fashioned atmosphere, just as "information highway" or "genetic engineering" makes people feel the fresh future atmosphere. The term "empire" is now so outdated that it can create imaginative moods in movies or literary works. In the past few years, I heard the name of the movie "The Counterattack of the Empire". It seems that the empire is absolutely out of the world; or "The Sun Empire" is already cruel to be eliminated by history.</p>\n<p>In the seventeenth century, Chinese society entered a state of serious crisis. The crisis not only comes from the structural changes of the internal society, but also from the internal pressures of external upheavals. In Marx\'s words: a society with backward productivity is destined to be challenged by a society with advanced productivity. The long-term stagnation of China\'s feudal society has made it inevitable to fall into this situation.</p>\n<p>The "stagnant empire" is a kind of logic: the existence of an empire is often based on the maintenance of the existing order and system. The logic empire requires a mechanism of stagnation. Otherwise, the huge mechanism of the empire will be peeled off and will be weathered and disintegrated in the midst of changes. From Nebuchadnezzar in New Babylon to the Emperor Qianlong, they all know this. Therefore, closure is not a choice for a whim in the morning, but the inevitability of an empire. The famous scholar Eisenstadt proposed in the book "The Political System of the Empire" that the primary goal of the imperial ruler is to "establish and maintain a unified and centralized regime, and the ruler\'s absolute power over the regime." Closed society is the way to maintain this system, and it is an inescapable way. Any open mechanism will eventually affect the power system of the feudal empire itself. Qianlong pays attention to the system as much as he does. At such a high level, the only handle to experience the dinosaur-like feudal regime was the feudal system, so the system could not be shaken, not only to prevent the internal forces from impacting it, but also to guard against external shocks. This will inevitably lead to the closure of the system and the closure of society.</p>\n<p>The development of history is often illogical: since the seventeenth century, the entire Western world has been attacking China, saying that China is a decaying and backward society, a stagnant and closed society. China\'s development logic should be in addition to the old and new, to join the development trend of the contemporary world, vigorously develop modern science and technology, develop the economy, and change the cultural spirit of society. However, when this time comes, Westerners often worry about it.</p>\n<p>Even people are worried. Since 1978, Chinese society has embarked on the road of reform and opening up, truly embraces the world, embraces modern science and technology and culture, and China\'s economic and social development has now achieved unprecedented development. In 1993, China’s national production growth reached 13%, and it was unique in the whole world and in East Asia. Then a new paradox emerged, the so-called "China threat theory." It’s really backward, and development is not going to work. The underlying reason here is the understanding of different cultures. Since development cannot be achieved on different value systems, any development will cause anxiety. In this sense, Perefett’s "the impact of the two worlds" did not end, perhaps just beginning.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0067.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0067.md",frontmatter:{title:"Monday 4 April 4"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0067.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
