I still can't say what kind of book is like the taste of other western novels. There are some psychological aspects of analysis, and at the same time a lot of modern social and cultural knowledge, so that the book appears to have a certain modernity. Other western novels are mainly local flavors. They seek an artistic result in folklore and tradition. Some may also find too primitive, and there is no literary beauty.</p>\n<p>Prepare the outline of the symposium to be held in the legal office of the municipal government, mainly on the subject of the legal construction of the Shanghai government. The construction of the government legal system is probably also characterized by Chinese characteristics. Other countries may not mention this, only we have. This is probably necessary in the early stages of market economy development.</p>\n<p>Receive an American at Yifu Building. He came to discuss some issues, mainly concerned with the relationship between the central and local. The analysis of the Americans is that after the economy develops, the local powers are getting bigger and bigger, and there are some anarchist tendencies in the economy. The concern is whether the development of this tendency will cause problems for political integration.</p>\n<p>At present, it probably won't. China's political integration is challenged by the economic field, but it is generally solid. The question is what direction the power of the economy will develop. The future situation depends on political parties, the military and cadres. This is the most important force for China's integration. He said that Americans care about human rights. I said that Chinese culture may be different from that of the United States. There are many problems that Americans cannot understand. So don't force each other as well. The development of Chinese society should be analyzed by Chinese standards. The Democratic Partyâ€™s China policy seems to be less clear and has a \"democracy\" strategy, but whether this is in the interest of the United States does not have deeper thinking.</p>",id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0045.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0045.md",frontmatter:{title:"Monday, February 28"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0045.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
