The four young people who were in the society were accused by the police of being the mastermind of an explosion. The police used various methods to recruit them and finally achieved their goals. And they also put several of their relatives into prison. After the real Republican Army was captured and accounted for, the police still did not reverse the case, and they continued to stay in prison. Later the father died in prison. A female lawyer, after painstaking efforts, found out the truth and after being imprisoned for fifteen years, they were all released by the court. After such an experience, the young man seems to mature, and finally he said that the truth must be ascertained. However, it seems that there is no clear result at the end.</p>\n<p>The film has a real social background and reflects the irrational political and non-democratic politics that exist in Western society.
