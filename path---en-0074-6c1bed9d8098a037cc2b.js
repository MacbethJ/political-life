However, from the book, we can also see the difference between the East and the West on some basic issues of sex, and the change of Western concepts. Such as the concept of homosexuality and other sexual behaviors. The change of sexual morality is one of the biggest changes in Western social culture in the twentieth century. What impact on social politics is a problem worthy of analysis. At present, there is no research and we cannot express opinions casually.</p>\n<p>Written in the book of political philosophy:</p>\n<p>The major western political philosophical systems, important and non-important, subtle or obvious, are based on the development of real politics, and are deeply influenced by the actual political process. They are all real political life in ideology. Reflection in the field. And this dominant point, or the central axis, is the situation of democratic politics in contemporary human society.</p>\n<p>No political community in the world can say that it has achieved a truly ideal democratic politics. The form of democratic politics that emerged in real political life has raised more questions for people. These problems seem to be unsolvable in the twentieth century, but it depends on whether people have the power to solve them in the 21st century. Therefore, the basic debate and basic motivation of contemporary Western political philosophy comes from the difficulty of realizing democratic politics, not from the success of democratic politics.</p>\n<p>Contemporary Western political development has established a new structure for the structure of political philosophy: democratic politics has increasingly become an indispensable part of personal life, and people are increasingly discussing the issue of democracy from their personal circumstances. A fundamental dilemma facing western political philosophy is also here: how to unify the value of external democracy with the inner life value of human beings, so that democratic politics is no longer external to human power, and people are no longer for democracy. Democracy, but democracy and democracy for life and for life.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0074.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0074.md",frontmatter:{title:"Monday, April 11"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0074.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
