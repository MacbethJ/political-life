The story written with color does not seem to be profound. The story is relatively flat and there is no extensive or concentrated social significance.</p>\n<p>Open the morning meeting in the morning. The basic policy of establishing a hospital is proposed. The basic policy is to devolve transactional powers to various departments and give full play to the enthusiasm of the department. In a group, there must always be enthusiasm in many aspects, otherwise vitality and creativity will not be enough. But to what extent power is decomposed is related to the quality of each component. The quality of each part is high, then the power can be decomposed to a large extent. If the quality of each component is low, the power is difficult to decompose. As big as the country, small to the system, the general principle is the same.</p>\n<p>In addition, we are preparing to establish a team to draft the development strategy of the institute. This is the spiritual thing of the college. Only the spiritual things stand up, and the entire college can stand up.</p>\n<p>Reply to L. In the letter, I said that I am still "crashing the clock", saying that we are like the monks who do the learning, have no desire, and feel at ease. L asked me a few years ago: "Do you make sense every day?" I said ": Do you know why monks should chanting?" I said in the letter: "It is rare for someone to think of my happiness, in my heart. I am very touched. People like us have become accustomed to life without happiness, that is, the dull life. Without the desire for happiness, there is no pain. Pain is often accompanied by the pursuit of happiness, not with happiness itself. So what is to be doubted is not happiness itself, but the hope in each person\'s subjective state. My question is: \'Why do monks want to recite the scriptures?\' This question can be answered, and everything is attributed to plainness. It is called peace to raise unlimited opportunities. Happiness, If you want to do so, you can\'t ask for it. You can\'t ask for it. After practicing for so many years, there is enough space in your heart, there is no happiness. Of course, I don\'t object to others\' pursuit of happiness, because people cannot live the same life."</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0155.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0155.md",frontmatter:{title:"October 8th Saturday"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0155.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
