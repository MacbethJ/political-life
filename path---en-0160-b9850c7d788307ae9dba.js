It is mainly to establish a historical perspective for in-depth analysis of the status quo and development trend of Chinese politics. This is very important for understanding and studying Chinese politics. Without a sense of history, we cannot analyze Chinese politics very historically. And Chinese society, because of its long history, cannot be studied without historical analysis.</p>\n<p>I talked about the main points of the historical analysis of China\'s political development:</p>\n<p>Politics of ancient society: closed society, separation and circulation, chaotic cycle, value unification, and institutional success;</p>\n<p>Politics in modern society: external force intervention, system decline, value crisis, social transformation;</p>\n<p>Politics in contemporary society: revolutionary society, planned economy, industrialization, value revolution;</p>\n<p>The politics of society now: reforming society, market economy, modernization, and value determination.</p>\n<p>Of course, these are all big lines. How to analyze and expand them, each person may be different. However, no matter whether it is doing political research in history or doing historical research in politics, these issues must be considered, that is, the problems of the past and the present.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0160.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0160.md",frontmatter:{title:"Monday, October 17th"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0160.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
