What he said was "a kind of human exchange." Generally good teachers have this feeling. Students give you a life reverberation, a living knowledge object, a fluid consciousness process, and a two-way information exchange. This is probably not possible with any other profession. This is the greatest pleasure of the teacher. But to experience such a happy life, the first thing to do is to suffer, that is, the suppression of desire. This is especially true in todayâ€™s world of opportunities for prosperity and materialism.</p>\n<p>There is a logic that is difficult to uncover. When a person starts to be a teacher, it is probably difficult to experience this kind of fun. It is more to experience the pain mentioned above, because his knowledge, personality and life do not allow him to experience. Driven by various forces, he will leave the teacher position, or lose the true spiritual realm of the teacher. In this way, he will never experience the true happiness of teachers, the joy of communicating with life, and the happiness of life. And will be happy in terms of material. Only after the pain of suppressing material desires can talents enjoy this high level of fun. The question is how many people can enjoy this kind of fun?</p>\n<p>Nothing can be fun than shaping life, especially the joy of life success. Who is the person who is the first obligation to shape life? In addition to the life that the mother gives to the material, the teacher is the most influential force and the most insignificant force for shaping spiritual life.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it is a great spiritual joy to see students grow up. I often ask students questions: "Do you have mental pain?" In fact, it is asking: "Do you have spiritual happiness?" Most people can\'t talk about the painful happiness at this level. But can a person who has no spiritual pain and happiness exist as a person who has come to this world? Is it a person who has had a real life?</p>\n<p>Why not? Why? Need a creative happiness.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0118.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0118.md",frontmatter:{title:"Sun on Sunday, June 26"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0118.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
