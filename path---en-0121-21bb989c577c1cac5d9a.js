The third volume of "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" is discussed in the third volume. This is a new problem that has emerged in recent years. In the process of economic development and social development, the central authority is not as good as before under the influence of various factors. However, at present, both the development of the cause and the historical stage require the central government to have certain authority. Without such authority, not only economic development and social development will not be able to go up, but also political problems will occur.</p>\n<p>Deng Xiaoping said: "My central point is that the central government must have authority. If the reform is to succeed, it must be carried out in an orderly manner." "Can\'t engage in \'you have policies, I have countermeasures\', and can\'t engage in \'countermeasures\' against central policies. "The Party Central Committee and the State Council have no authority, and the situation cannot be controlled." "The central government has decided to implement measures. All localities and departments must resolutely implement them. Not only must they be quick but also powerful, otherwise they will not be able to govern."</p>\n<p>How to maintain the central authority is a problem that must be discussed at present.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0121.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0121.md",frontmatter:{title:"Saturday, July 16th"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0121.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
