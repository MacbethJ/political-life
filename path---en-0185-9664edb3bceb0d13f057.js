In this way, society can develop healthily and the market economy may become a stable economy. Generally speaking, the market economy is driven by the incentive of individuals to pursue interests, and politics must be based on the protection of the public interest. How to balance the logic of these two mechanisms is a problem that must be solved when developing a market economy. The basic approach is: there must be a system structure in the constitution, a proper system in the government setting, a clear procedure in the operation of the transaction, and a proper feedback and guarantee system in the overall mechanism.
