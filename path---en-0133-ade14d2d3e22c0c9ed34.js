There are a lot of book stalls, about twenty, and most of them are similar and somewhat different. Probably the channel for the book is one. The popular books of these two days are Wallace\'s set of four books and Lawrence\'s set of four books, all of which are novels. I chose Wallaceâ€™s set to buy. There is also a book by Brzezinski on the world situation in the 21st century. The main point is that the world is in a state of chaos, and new order has not yet formed. A small book, more than 13 yuan, did not buy.</p>\n<p>The book stall is booming, a lot of people. There are many types of books, and not all books that are not on the table. Most are still more serious. Books in the social sciences account for a relatively large proportion, such as the books on Cambridge Chinese history, which are generally hardcover. Wushu novels can\'t be without, this is a popular one. Wushu novels are generally famous, such as Jin Yong, Gu Long and others. Most of them are novels, such as the works of Wallace and Lawrence mentioned above, and the popular local novels, what is "Wife Life", "Heaven Hunting", "Ground Hunting", "Wild Love", "Distorted People" "Tujie", etc., I do not know whether it is true or false. What is the customs of the earth and the earth, mixed with more imaginary or original depictions of the rural emotional life, in order to pave the story. At first, the sales were good, and it seems to have cooled down now. In addition, there are more books on life, palms, faces, feng shui, etc.</p>\n<p>The book stalls are looked after by some girls, as if they were not Beijingers. This reflects the fact that the market is highly organized here and may be managed in a unified manner. These girls came to Beijing from other places and were hired. They had an income of 200 yuan a month, and the boss took care of them.</p>\n<p>There are so many book stalls that can be opened all the way, as if Shanghai did not find such a place. This place is a market, there are a lot of stalls next to it, selling clothing and other various things, feasting. Books can occupy such a large piece of land, not easy. The most important reason is to have a market.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0133.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0133.md",frontmatter:{title:"August 13th Saturday"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0133.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
