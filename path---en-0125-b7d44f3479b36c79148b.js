This revision, according to himself, is more thorough. Keynesianism has received more and more criticism after the war, and there are also many problems in practice. Economics dominated by Keynesianism had to modify itself and absorb the views of other schools, such as monetarism and supply schools. The 12th edition has been absorbed in these aspects.</p>\n<p>I read his chapter on the role of the government and felt that there was still inspiration. What role the government plays in economic development is very crucial. His main means of government action on the economy are fiscal policy, monetary policy, tax policy, financial policy (exchange rate), and public spending. These means are probably useful in a capitalist economic way. But under the conditions of socialism, are these means sufficient? Can it play such a role? It is worth exploring.</p>\n<p>Under the conditions of incomplete market economy, what kind of means is the best, there is no saying, and there is no proof in practice. For example, taxation is a common means in capitalist countries, but it is not possible in socialist countries and does not form the necessary taxation system. Taxation in Western countries relies heavily on personal income tax. And our personal income tax ratio is too low to play a big role. It is really necessary to manage the personal income tax, and it cannot keep up with the technical and management. It has not established a complete taxation system, and electronic computer technology and networks have not been established, so it is difficult to form a complete system.</p>\n<p>Such textbooks, regardless of content, are written to suit teaching, it is clear that the object is college students. We don't have such systematic textbooks right now. Large scholars do not bother to write such a book, publishers are not willing to come out, considering economic benefits. In fact, if you really write it, you can guarantee economic benefits. Many foreign publishers rely on textbooks for profit. Of course, there are also books written for the benefit.</p>\n<p>Textbooks are a reflection of the educational level of a university or even a country and a mirror of academic standards. If Fudan University can produce some high-quality textbooks, its reputation will be greatly enhanced, and the radiation power of knowledge to society will also rise.</p>",id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0125.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0125.md",frontmatter:{title:"Sunday on July 24th"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0125.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
