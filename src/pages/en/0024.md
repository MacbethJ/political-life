The "addiction" episode is developing and has been divorced. Too much love, not a good thing, not so love, not a good thing, not a love, not a good thing, what to do? Human suffering.

C Jun came and took the manuscript of "The Revelation of the Lion City" and discussed it with him. He recently went to Beijing and said that some people lived in a dash, only the following people are still working hard. I think that the development of Chinese society is to have hard-working people. If everyone is chic, this society cannot progress. Some people want to talk loudly, but what is more important in a society is that people do things one by one.
