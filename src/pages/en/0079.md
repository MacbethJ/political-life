L Jun took us to see a strange person. We sat down in the living room and came out. It looks different from the average person and is not tall. I said it was a friend of L. He said that you should sit down. He kept walking around and there were many people in the living room. He has a large number of key phones in his hand. He said that L's car is not what he said, he will not let him say, tell me that when the car is waiting for a while, something will happen. His legend has been listening for a long time, that is, the bottle can be taken out of the unopened bottle, the chewed business card can be restored, the words in the envelope can be recognized, the things can be carried by mind, and so on. Many people have seen it with their own eyes.

He took out two books about him and gave it to us. He signed the name and said goodbye. He came to us.
