At the meeting of the Development Strategy Planning Group of the Faculty of Law, the participants of the three departments all expressed their opinions and had many good ideas. The key is to have ideas, no ideas, and nothing can be done. The basic strategy is to first determine the internal development direction of the law school, that is, the direction of academic development, the main areas of attack and key breakthrough areas, and then arrange all resources, management, teaching and scientific research around this center. Especially for the cultivation of students, this is the product of our teaching unit, and finally we must compete in the market. People's competition is probably the most intense and essential competition in all market competition.

The results of the discussion are:

From the perspective of the law school as a whole, it is possible to jointly fight: policy science, international culture (history and current status of human civilization), environmental science, administrative science, human rights issues, social development, etc.

From the perspective of various departments, the direction that can be developed is: business demography, urban sociology, community development, social undertakings, comparative civil and commercial law, international economic law, and history of legal thought.

How to develop further, we must continue to think and collide, and then demonstrate.
