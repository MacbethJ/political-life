I didn't go home yesterday and work in the office. When the night is quiet, it is especially conducive to the operation of thinking. Looking at the cars and pedestrians who accidentally walked on the street, I feel that it is a quiet and beautiful enjoyment.

In the early morning, I turned over the book "Ancient Chinese Sex Culture". There are many such books, but there are not many studies from the perspective of learning, most of which are for market value. Someone once translated a book written by the Dutch, called "Ancient Chinese House Test", the name gives a more distinct feeling, the original name does not seem to be the case. More than half of it is for people to understand at a glance, and buy it when they understand it.

In class, I talked about the concept of a concept exchange. Many ideologies must be exchanged by concepts to understand. Without such processing, they will not understand, such as medieval theological and political thoughts. Some academic systems supported by modern science and technology, such as systems science, information theory, and cybernetics-supported social science systems, must also be translated. This is an important methodological issue in the history of thought, and it is also a core issue in today's academic research. Without a concept system of its own, there can be no complete ideology.

I opened Shanghai's top ten elite conferences in Shanghai Education Hall. I said at the meeting: I love the work of teachers, and I also love students. Without such love, you cannot be a good teacher. I believe that educating students is what they want to do most. The highest realm of my life is to write a few good books and teach a few good students. Career has become a part of my lifestyle, a way I exist in this world, and I can't live without it. When I was abroad, the most missed office was the office and the students.

Mencius said that a gentleman has three music, one is to teach the world with talent, this is the greatest happiness. People who live today often say that they are incompetent and make China like this. We hope that the Chinese in the future will not say that todayâ€™s Chinese are incompetent and make China like this. This is my biggest wish.
