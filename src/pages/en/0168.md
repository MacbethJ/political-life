In the early morning, I read "The Secretaries of Mao Zedong" and wrote the six secretaries of Mao Zedong: Hu Qiaomu, Chen Boda, Tian Jiaying, Jiang Qing, Gao Zhi and Luo Luguang. They have rich descriptions of materials and details, and have a new understanding of many things in the past. . Disclose Mao Zedong's comment on poetry: "Poetry is difficult, it is not easy to write, and experienced people like fish and drinking water, and cold and warm self-knowledge is not enough for outsiders." It is a profound understanding of poetry.

In the afternoon, the computer virus appeared and destroyed a disk of hundreds of thousands of words. Hope there is still a backup, or it will be miserable.
