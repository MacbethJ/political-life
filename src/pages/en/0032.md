On the fourth day of the year, every household must welcome the god of wealth. The firecrackers started to sound from 11 o'clock and have been ringing all night, surpassing all the years. The firecrackers continued to ring in the morning. It can be seen how great the people's mentality has changed. The changes in the psychological structure and cultural structure of Chinese society are enormous and profound. What this change means for the development of a nation can not be said now, and it may be more clear in the future.
