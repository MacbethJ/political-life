Write an article about the debate, basically complete, just polish it. Added a paragraph to write humor and wit. It is not easy to get these things. It must come from a life attitude, an attitude towards life beyond, a serious attitude, or a detached choice for the path of life. This will have humor, otherwise you can't talk about humor.
