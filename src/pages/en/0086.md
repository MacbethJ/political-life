Someone brought a piece of black and white paper, saying it was a three-dimensional painting. Just stare at it and you will see a three-dimensional picture. I watched it for a long time and didn't see it. After seeing it out, I realized that when I started to look at it, my mind was too clear. This kind of picture had to blur the line of sight, and then I had a picture, and it was three-dimensional, like transparent glass. Itâ€™s amazing. I don't know who invented it, and the inventor is really not easy.

People tend to be confused. The more concentrated they are, the more confused they are, sometimes they are sloppy, but they will not be confused.
