Take a walk to Tiananmen Square. There is a festive atmosphere here, and the National Day is coming. The Tiananmen Gate was renovated and the red walls were painted. The young pioneers stood on the banks of the Jinshui River.

There is a big change in the square, and a large green belt is formed in the middle of the square. To the east is a dragon made of flowers, the west is a phoenix, the back is a pagoda made of flowers, and the model of a ship is named "Sea World". A large number of people gathered in the square, beaming, taking pictures and watching. The huge slogan on Chang'an Street was set up, and the national flag fluttered in the wind. The birthday of the Republic is coming.
