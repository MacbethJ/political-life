I saw a review article on the "China threat theory" abroad. After the Chinese economy developed, this kind of public opinion gradually rose and became a theory of a certain market. Mainly that China's future may be the country with the strongest comprehensive economic strength in the world, and thus pose a threat to the surrounding countries. Said that China is developing military power. This is a strange remark. The Chinese economy is not developing. There is a bitterness around it, the economy is going to develop, and it is scared. Around China, there is still a country with stronger military power than China, but it is not a "threat." Japan’s military costs are second in the world, but not “threats”. This kind of paradox has a certain market in Japan.

This kind of "China threat theory" can be ignored.
