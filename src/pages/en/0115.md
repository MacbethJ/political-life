Reading a novel "The Plague" in the early morning, with the Northwest as the background story, is a modern fable. The story itself has a lot of absurdity, but people have a feeling of mysterious culture. After reading it, it is fictional. There is a kind of Implied, perhaps the author is not clear about the meaning itself. It took a lot of time to unify the annotations and styles of "Confusion of Democracy". Although the computer brings a lot of convenience, but because of the convenience, it also increases the time for modification, and always wants to be perfect. Change the title of the first chapter to "confused democracy" and change the title of the conclusion to "the foreground in the shackles" to be consistent with the heading style of each chapter.
