In the early morning, I saw the "PARTICIPATION" of the International Political Society on the theme and report of this year's international conference. The theme is "democratization". There are many sub-topics below. The issue of democratization is becoming more and more important in today's world and the basic development direction of society. This year's international conference was opened in Berlin. The Chinese Political Society has withdrawn from the International Political Society. The theme is good, and we should study it well in China.

In addition, I read the collection of the Political Science of the Chinese Political Society. There are not many good articles. Several graduate students have published articles on the above.
