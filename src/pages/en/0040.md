Start school, report. The liberal arts building had no electricity, and everyone had to pick up the ranks and complain.

Revise the English article on political system reform. It took an afternoon to finish. The program in this computer is very good, has some advantages over Chinese WPS, can handle comments. This is the most difficult problem in Chinese software. Probably also related to the way Chinese people write articles. Chinese people wrote articles in the past and did not pay much attention to materials and materials. Therefore, there is no such requirement for computer software. Now the situation has changed. The article has more and more comments, and the requirements are getting higher and higher. If not, it will not work. However, I believe that the power of the market is probably solvable as long as there is a market.
