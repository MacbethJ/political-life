A friend asked me if I have children, I said that there are no children. I asked, how do you think about the family? I said that I also want to have a good family. Any busy man wants to have a warm home. He feels happy when he returns home after a busy day. But sometimes there is no way, and it is hopeless.

While walking, I picked some mulberry fruit on the tree and thought of the natural state that Rousseau said. This kind of life is hopeless and unattainable. Get a poem:

Traveling with Big Brother

Clear pool bends,

Stepping on the greenstone on the green hill.

The four pillars of the town,

One tower has no water pool.

The Summer Palace is deep and easy to find.

It is difficult to see fish in Kunming Lake.

Take away thousands of flowers,

East to Xia color as a monarch.
