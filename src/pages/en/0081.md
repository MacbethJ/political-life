In the early morning, I read some chapters of the second part of "Zeng Guofan" and did not finish reading. I finished the first part yesterday. It is said that this book is liked in the capital. This is a historical novel. The basic meaning lies in the process of how Zeng grew up in troubled times. It also describes the contrast between political and military forces in troubled times. The description of China's past officialdom and the description of the power struggle in the officialdom are also profound. It’s just that the object is the Taiping Army, so you can’t help but use the Taiping Army as a foil.
