Visit L home. He said that he had a lawsuit in the B city. The situation was that he was introduced by a Beijing friend and knew a woman over there. The woman said that she was the Municipal Bureau of Justice, and he talked about the business of 2020 Big Brother, worth more than 14 million yuan. He did not trust, went there, met the judicial director and the mayor. This will be shipped. But there has been no payment there. As a result, the Justice Bureau did not admit that the woman was hired by them, not a formal employee. This matter took a long time and was not handled well. This time, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau came forward and issued a "consultation notice." The result was to seize the woman in Jinzhou. The Public Security Bureau has informed him. I don't know what the final result will be. This is a new problem in China's economic development and a reflection of disorder. The question is how can the Judicial Bureau be involved in such a thing as a state organ?
