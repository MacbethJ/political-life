Study Conde. Comte's positivism has an important influence on the development of Western thoughts, both philosophical and political. The issues of order and progress he discussed are still of great significance in today's human society. Most of the society is difficult to handle this relationship in the development process. The development of Chinese society is also the same. How to establish a new order in development, no order can be completed without any development, but a fixed or firm order will affect social progress. This is a contradiction. The development of Chinese society basically breaks the original order and promotes social progress. After a certain period of time, a new order is needed. Without a new order, further development is impossible.

Comte is a thinker who established his own doctrine system in the turbulent times. Therefore, he emphasizes the integrity and consistency of society in terms of philosophy, which is different from the thinkers in the bourgeois revolution. They emphasize the idea of ​​individualism. Under different social conditions, people's minds are always affected, and it is impossible to be affected. Many of the doctrines of today are actually the products of the times. I don’t see the problem in this way.
