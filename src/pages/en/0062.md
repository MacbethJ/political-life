In the early morning, I continued to study the book "MS_DOS6.0" and grasped some new features. Using a computer has changed the way I write articles, and it has also changed my way of thinking. The main idea is that the concept is different. When writing with a pen, the strokes are drawn. With the computer's pinyin input method, the first is the sound. I don't know what kind of changes will happen to people who enter in other ways. In the future, there will be different classes in the society, divided by different ways of thinking created by computers.
