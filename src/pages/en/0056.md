It’s getting up in the morning, it’s raining outside, and the wind is not small. Going to the meeting of the Municipal Government Legal Affairs Office is to solicit opinions from various experts on the topic of "Legal Construction of Shanghai Internationalized Metropolitan Government in the 21st Century."

The process of social modernization is the process of legalization, and it cannot be said that it is modernization. As some people have said, in some cities in the United States, the law stipulates that eating garlic and the like takes half an hour to go to public places; it is stipulated that during the period when the store advertisements are sold at a reduced price, all the goods in the store must be available. Can not be without; the responsibility of government employees is clear. The law is a big rule abroad, and no one can violate it. In China, the law has not yet reached such a position. The law is a big concept, and few people can make it clear. This is the difference.
