Think about the relationship between the central and local, write on paper:

The authority of the central government should be written from the authority of the whole party. In the reform and opening up, the whole party must have authority. The concentrated representative of this authority is the central government;

The central and local party organizations must have authority, but the key is the central government, the central government has authority, and the local authorities have authority;

Maintaining the authority of the central government is to maintain the authority of the whole;

If there is no existing decision in the central government involved, the central government must be requested;

The decision of major local issues is notified to the central government in a timely manner;

The locality is motivated and creative under the unified leadership of the central government;

The central government actively supports local work;

The local party committee has the responsibility to ensure that the central government order is unimpeded in the region;

The essence of central authority is the unified leadership on the basis of the united will of the whole party;

The correct decision can guarantee efficiency;

Those belonging to government management should be resolved through democratic centralism, and those that do not belong should be resolved through market mechanisms.
