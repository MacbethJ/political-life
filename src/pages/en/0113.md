Walking in the evening, a big circle, the weather is getting hotter and hotter, but the greenery here is still so lush. The weather was hot and the fish in the pond floated to the surface of the water, where it floated leisurely and there was no movement. It seems that all the world's battles have stopped. Looking at them, a kind of leisurely taste is born. Get a poem:

Nostalgia on the mountain

The winding path is strewn with trees,

The waves are quiet and the mountains are bright.

After abandoning the fish fishing,

Before listening to the flying é¹Š Lin Zhongxiang.

Thousands of things are outside the world,

The moment is only cool.

Twilight light carrying the stone road,

The bridge slanted ancient road horses.
