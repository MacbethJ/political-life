Go to Beidaihe today. The train opened for four hours and went to Beidaihe, which was already 11:20 noon. After moving things into the car, drive away directly from the platform. There are tourists on the road like tides. About 20 minutes, I arrived at a wooded place. Under the command of the police, we turned into a road, and soon we arrived at the building where we lived, a small Western-style building.

Going by the sea, I spent three dollars to buy swimming trunks and a swimming cap. Going for a swim after dinner, swimming for a while, there is a feeling of longing into the vast sea and longing for two poems:

Swimming wave

Far from the wind, the rush is near,

Tao Libo has a long dike and is low.

The turbid waves are coming to the sea,

The sandpaper is going to calm down.

The vulgarity gradually turns into a peak,

The holy thoughts are in the water.

Reappearing,

Seeing that Xiangke is fighting again.

Swimming in the sea

The sun is covered,

Gradually into the vastness of the arrogant.

Tao Ming flows dark and does not live,

The wind rushed to the beach.

Pillow waves look up at the floating clouds,

Cangbo straight up the mountain.

There have been vicissitudes of life in the world.

æ´Ž Gumena hunting fish sails.
