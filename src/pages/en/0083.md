Going to the Central Party School to buy books, the bookstore there is not small, bought a book of more than one hundred yuan, there are Samuelson's "Economics" 12th edition, "Future Socialism" and other books. A book on the philosophy of ancient India, "Shun Shi", wants to see how they think about problems, and what is the difference between logic and philosophy. The way in which Indian philosophy thinks about problems is quite different. Maugham’s novel Blade is greatly influenced by Indian philosophy.

Everyone talked about the problem of cadre wages being too low. In this case, China’s management cannot be done well, and where the best talents of the society go. Without a benign mechanism, excellent talents will not flow to the management hub of the state and the party, so that core management will be in the long run. A problem will occur. This is a strategic issue.
