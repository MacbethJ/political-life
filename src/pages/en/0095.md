Taiwan’s "United Daily News" said that I proposed to carry out political system reform, which is different from the official line. I read that it was the article published in "Looking for Hope", titled "Chinese Political Science in Development." It’s really interesting. How is it different from the official route? I don’t understand Chinese politics. I have also been talking about political system reform, and I am amazed.
