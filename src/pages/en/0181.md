Go to the Shanghai International Education Exchange Center to participate in the primaries of social sciences.

The success of academic research, a large part of the topic, the selection of the topic is a prerequisite. You can see the problem in a place where others can't see the problem, see a special topic in a place where others see the general problem, and see a vertical problem in a place where others see the horizontal problem, and see where others see the vertical problem. These are the prerequisites for successful learning. The problem is that it is not easy to do this. It must be academically cultivated and rationally sensitive. It must have a special grasp of the problem.

Therefore, academic researchers are also pioneers of new fields, that is, creators. If you only work in places that others have developed, there is obviously no big creativity. The whole problem is to discover new areas, just like discovering the New World.

At 7 o'clock, visit Huating Hotel to participate in the welcome reception of the International Academic Symposium on "Towards the 21st Century Internationalized Metropolis".
