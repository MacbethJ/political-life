Reading "Documentary and Fiction" in the early morning is a novel that seems to be the author's experience, or a development of his own experience. I haven't finished reading yet, and I can't conclude now. It talks about a unique cultural phenomenon in Chinese society after 1949, or something unique in urban social life. After the People’s Liberation Army entered the city, two different cultures were formed in the society. One was the revolutionary culture cast by Yan’an, which was embodied in the novel as “comrade” culture, and the other was the culture that was originally in the city. "Small citizen" culture.

This novel uses this conflict or gap to develop the plot. However, these two cultures have existed in modern cities for a while, and have exerted an inestimable influence on people's social life, political life and psychological structure. Studying the social development of contemporary Chinese society cannot ignore this point. Recently, the development of the market economy and the commodity economy has made this difference in culture smaller and smaller. The commodity culture has tremendous power and can break through all cultural barriers.
