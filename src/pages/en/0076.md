In class, continue to talk about Nietzsche. Nietzsche's doctrine is actually worth studying because he proposed his political thoughts in an era when the world order needs change. His purpose is to establish a new order and finally to rely on "superman." When there is such a need in history, that is, when a new order needs to be established, there will always be such a thinker who advocates the establishment of a new order with strength and through strong men. The question is whether the new order can be established, or whether it has its own development logic, no matter how hard people try, and finally it is such an order.
