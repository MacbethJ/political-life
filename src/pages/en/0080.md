I concentrated on some articles and prepared to write "The Government in the Post-Revolution Society." How can this book be written, and be well designed, with new entry points. The government in the post-revolutionary society is a subject worthy of study. Not only does China's development require such research, but from the development of the post-revolutionary government in the general sense, it is also beneficial to study the understanding of the development of China and other societies in the world. See how you can write such a theme.

The basic idea is to discuss from the perspective of "social resources", from the perspective of the revolution breaking the state machine and rebuilding the state machine, and the role of the political system in the post-revolutionary society. These are the most important issues in the post-revolution society. After the revolution, society is a special society and a society that often appears in human history, but this is not a social form, but a special social structure, caused by the revolution itself. The question is how the society becomes an orderly society after the revolution and establishes a new order. This is the most basic way for the post-revolution society to transition to a stable society. If this is not resolved, the post-revolution society is an unstable society.
