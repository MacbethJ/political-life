Another comment was made on the manuscript of the relationship between the central and local governments. The nature of central power requires:

The political jurisdiction of the central government is the manifestation of national sovereignty. All localities and departments must resolutely obey and cannot violate any violations. The central administrative authority should be determined according to the needs of social development. After the determination, all localities and departments must also Resolutely obey, there can be no violations;

When exercising their own jurisdiction, all localities and departments must carefully analyze and judge the influence and effects of their own power behaviors, and consciously prevent acts that weaken and damage the central authority;

Establish a clear system and formulate a complete legal norm to ensure that jurisdiction at all levels is used in a defined system, while seriously restricting and punishing violations of fundamental principles;

In organizing personnel, there must be a guarantee to maintain the authority of the central government. Persons and institutions that do not correct the violation of the central authority must be dealt with in accordance with laws and disciplines.
