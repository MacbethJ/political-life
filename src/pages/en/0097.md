The second chapter of "The Government of the Post-Revolution Society" discusses what kind of changes have taken place in the basic structure and basic relationship of society in a changing society, and then what kind of government development should be done according to this change. This question shows that the overall trend is well grasped, and it will have a rough grasp of the development of the entire government. From the general trend, it is still my original induction:

The ideological line has undergone a total innovation;

Modernization has become a socialist main project;

Market mechanism is constantly improving and developing

Political life is becoming institutionalized and legalized;

The traditional systems have gradually been transferred to the new system through reforms;

A full range of connections with the outside world;

The concept of democracy and democratic rights are fully affirmed;

Comprehensive development and application of modern science and technology;

The full development and prosperity of cultural and artistic education;

All members of society can fully rejuvenate the spirit and create spirit.

Analyzing the general trend of the development of the Chinese government is to proceed in this general framework.
