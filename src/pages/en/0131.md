Going to the sea to swim, the waves are very big, overwhelming, and people are hit below. Everyone joked that now I know what is called the disaster. I feel very challenging. Have the courage to meet the challenge in life. We probably don't have the challenge as we have in the past.

Here, I also feel that there is a moment of leisure. Get a poem:

Have a leisurely feeling

Bai Si suddenly broke into the land,

Sleeve the sleeves and open the dress.

Must be greeted by the wind,

The heart is gone.

One drink spring liquid than the syrup,

Try the game.

With the easy to smash the golden sand,

Lying in the waves is like a confused.
