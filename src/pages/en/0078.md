The public taxi will be taken to the airport. On the way, the driver chooses the shortcut to arrive at the airport 40 minutes before the scheduled departure time. It is very dangerous, because 30 minutes can not be used for air tickets. Every time I am always so nervous, I feel anxious in a modern life. If all the people live in this anxiety, there is no dispute on the street. An important issue in modernization is to enable people to have their own grasp in a tense life, to be able to grasp their own time and rhythm, otherwise people will be upset and need to vent.
