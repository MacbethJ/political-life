In the early morning, I read "Zhou Enlai who walked down the altar" and said that Zhou Enlai went to Chongqing by plane once and encountered bad weather.

In class, talk about "principles of legal philosophy." Hegel is an important part of understanding Western political thought. To truly understand the spirit of Western political philosophy, he must read Hegel. At the same time, Marx was also influenced by Hegel. Mainly logical, there is a revolutionary change in content. Hegel's exposition on civil society, state, power relations, law, and rights deserves a good analysis. The civil society has been very popular recently, and a large number of articles have been published. It is probably a Western perspective on the development of Chinese society. It is also a reflection of Western scholars on the development of China's democratic politics since 1978.

This kind of discussion affects Chinese scholars, some are fashionable, some are academic, and some are political.
