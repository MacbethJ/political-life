The Development Research Institute met to discuss the issue of writing the "94 China Development Report." Some people came to outline the writing plan and proposed to hand it over to the publishing house on January 5 next year. I hope that I can be as efficient as last year. In most cases, academic research can't be efficient. I want to talk about it, but sometimes I have to be efficient. There is no quick release without long product, and there is no point in not having a long-term product.
