Fromm\'s "Escape from Freedom" is a very deep book. I think China is caught in a contradiction: his theory is that in the process of the development of the market economy, in the process of carrying forward the modern individualistic culture, individuals gain freedom, but they are lonely. This makes it possible for individuals to escape from freedom. The situation in China is that in Eastern culture, escaping freedom comes from collectivist values. Thus, if China\'s market economy develops further, it will eventually lead to the expansion of the individual\'s free field, but in the end it may not be a more democratic one, but Fromm\'s "evasion of freedom." So what is the development trend of Chinese society?</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0068.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0068.md",frontmatter:{title:"Tuesday, April 5th"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0068.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
