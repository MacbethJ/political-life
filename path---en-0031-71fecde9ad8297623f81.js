I originally wanted to write a study on corruption. Later I wrote it on the whole and talked about how Chinese political science contributes to the construction of China's political system model. The basic argument is that China needs to improve its political system in its modernization. The recent international developments have also warned us that a society must have a good political system in order to maintain long-term stability. On the other hand, a sound political system must adapt to a certain national situation and must be rooted in the deep soil of a certain society. After the disintegration of the former Soviet Union and some countries in Eastern Europe, imitating the Western system did not form an effective political system, which had disastrous consequences and greatly affected social progress and stability.</p>\n<p>The general rule of perfecting and constructing the political system model of Chinese society is to continuously expand and strengthen socialist political democracy and social democracy. This is the purpose of socialist political development. China's democratic model must be based on the basic political principles of socialism, effectively guarantee the efficiency of the political system, guarantee political integration and social stability, and must be able to adapt to Chinese history, a social and cultural condition. If such conditions are not met, it is difficult to form a political system with Chinese characteristics. In my research, I gradually realized that studying this topic should solve such basic problems: (1) the relationship between super-large society and political regulation. (2) The relationship between one-party leadership and democratic politics. (3) The relationship between public ownership and the political system. (4) The relationship between ethical democracy and legal democracy.</p>\n<p>Studying and solving these four issues is an important aspect of establishing a political system model with Chinese characteristics. Of course, these are macro issues that cannot be solved at once. There are also a variety of meso and micro issues that need to be addressed. The formation of China's political system model may be a long process. However, precisely because there are such areas that can be developed, Chinese political science is promising. These questions, Western political science did not give the answer, and I am afraid it is difficult to give the answer.</p>",id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0031.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0031.md",frontmatter:{title:"Saturday, February 12"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0031.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
