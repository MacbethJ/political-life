One person stands in front of a small window in a small town in the south. Day after day, watching the wind blow the rain curtains around, watching the raindrops of the beans. In the loose soil of the flower beds and the delicate wings of the flowers that want to fly. "" The days are fading back and forth, extending forward. Every day, doing some introspective meditation to sort out the complicated memories. Sometimes I feel the colorful feelings. Sometimes, I give up the reins of thinking, stretch my mind and body, and indulge in the sound of the sacred music. Let the voices of the empty valley lead the way into carefree, trouble-free, irritated and ignorant. No my realm."</p>\n<p>"Thinking of the classmates of the past, all of them are rushing for survival. Only I still enjoy the peace of heaven. I sit on the bamboo bench leisurely, let the cool, drink tea, read the sage book, do DAYDREAM, indeed Blessed. I feel that these precious times should be cherished."</p>\n<p>People know self-sufficiency, sometimes the greatest source of happiness, and inner peace is better than all satisfaction.</p>',id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0171.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0171.md",frontmatter:{title:"October 29 Saturday"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0171.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
