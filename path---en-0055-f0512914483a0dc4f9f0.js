I said that the doctoral examination is not a textbook style. It depends on the students' usual accumulation and temporary preparations are not acceptable. The question is how much knowledge is accumulated in daily learning and how wide is the knowledge. Graduate students, especially doctoral students, must cultivate creativity rather than memories of dead knowledge. Otherwise it is impossible to train outstanding students. This is a direction. The second is to pay attention to the ability of logical analysis, to have strong rational reasoning ability, to be sensitive enough to things, to be able to find points that can be created in general knowledge. The third is to have a relatively sound personality. Without a sound personality, it is impossible to cultivate truly outstanding students. Outstanding is not only for the individual, but also for the social and academic spirit. This is the strategic direction we should pay attention to in the future.</p>",id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0055.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",fileAbsolutePath:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0055.md",frontmatter:{title:"March 11th Friday"}}},pathContext:{id:"/home/swain/workspace/political-life/src/pages/en/0055.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark"}}}});
